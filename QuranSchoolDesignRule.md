- **Body/UI:** Clean, modern sans-serif font for all body and interface text.
- **Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, and body text.
- **Weight:** Bold for headings, regular for body, lighter for secondary info.

## 2. Color Palette

- **Background:** Soft, off-white or very light beige.
- **Primary Accent:** Warm orange for CTAs (e.g., "Join room", "Download", "Continue", tab highlight).
- **Secondary Accent:** Muted teal/cyan for highlights and icons.
- **Text:** Black or dark brown for headings, medium gray for secondary text.
- **Cards/Sections:** Subtle, pastel backgrounds for cards and sections.

## 3. Components & Layout

- **Cards:** Rounded corners, subtle drop shadows, generous padding, clear separation.
- **Tabs:** Soft, pill-shaped with clear active/inactive states.
- **Buttons:** Rounded, filled with accent color, bold text.
- **Bottom Navigation:** Floating, pill-shaped, with clear icons and active state.
- **Switches & Toggles:** Modern, rounded, with clear on/off states.
- **Lists:** Use cards for list items, with images/icons, bold titles, and secondary info.

## 4. Spacing & Sizing

- **Whitespace:** Generous space between elements for an uncluttered feel.
- **Padding:** Consistent, uniform padding inside cards, buttons, and sections.
- **Touch Targets:** Large, easy-to-tap buttons and icons.

## 6. Accessibility

- **Contrast:** High contrast for text and interactive elements.
